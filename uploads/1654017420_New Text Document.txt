on the issue of jurisdiction, Team Anna is right in asking for original jurisdiction for
 Lokpal to have powers to institute suo moto investigation via the CBI into anti-corruption
 cases. For such cases, CBI's superintendence, direction and control must be under the 
Lokpal, something that the government's Lokpal Bill, 2011, already allows under Section 25.
 It doesn't give powers of suo moto investigation to Lokpal, which is prudent and should be
 agreed to.

However in several Supreme Court judgements, the court has upheld Section 173 of CrPC as 
supreme that the investigating officer cannot be given instructions even by the Supreme 
Court, so forget about the Lokpal doing so.

Allowing Lokpal, under Section 20(7), the powers to close a case or file a charge sheet, 
is violative of the purity of investigation as enunciated by various SC judgements. What 
Team Anna really wants is powers of higher police officer under Section 36 of the CrPC,
 which the government is not willing to give.
